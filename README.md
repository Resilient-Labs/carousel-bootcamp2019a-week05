# ðŸŽ  Week05 Bootcamp2019a Project: Carousel
For the carousel, I immediately thought of my top destinations. The images are my favorite places in Europe.

### Goal: Build a Simple Image Carousel
The Carousel was created to have the back and skip function. If you click on the "skip" button it will show you the next picture that follows and so forth.

I completed the challenge: 4
I feel good about my code: 2

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery

In the HTML, I used two buttons for the back and skip functions. Then, I created the JavaScript to build an array where it will hold all the images. I was able to call the back and skip functions by using document.ready (function) in the JavaScript. The CSS was only use to edit the sizes of the images.


## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to loop through an array of photos.
