# Wonderful World of Chucks
I love Converse shoes! When I was told to do a photo carousel I immediately thought of Chucks and the awesome collaborations they've had. Especially the Kith X Coke X Converse series. Unfortunately for me I was unable to purchase any due to the influx of bots on the online street wear scene.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

## Lessons Learned:

As a budding engineer a lot of information is learned through trial and error. My greatest lesson learned while working on this project and that I will implement in future projects is that google is that changing the height of a project is better then changing the width of a photo if you want to keep the picture visible.
