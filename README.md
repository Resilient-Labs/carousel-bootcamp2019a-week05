# Image Carousel
An application where user can press buttons to change an array of pictures.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jquery
In this project I used HTML to create an img element and two buttons. I used CSS to stylize where the image would display. I used JavaScript to give the buttons the function to change the picture.

## Lessons Learned:
In this project I learned how to use an array to store images in and using the .att() method to target the "src" attribute in the img tag in HTML to change the image source using buttons.
