# Charles' Carousel of Crappy memes
I created a quick and easy carousel that scrolls through a series of images, with the last image leading to the first image and vice versa.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Jquery)

This was a very simple project that uses an event listener to target changing an image source and if conditionals to allow the first and final images to go to and from each other.

## Optimizations

There are many things I'd like to do with this project to make it a little more interesting. have image sizes be more natural/different while preventing buttons position from changing, add background, add image border, center everything, add image transition effect, add random image burst, add project description to page and others, have previews of each image that can be clicked and change main image,
I can have a more dynamic way of handling the differing image sizes, I could add a background image and a border, center everything, add effects upon image transition, have a randomized appearance of other images for fun and have a clickable preview list that lets you choose specific images in the carousel.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to use Jquery a little more, as this is one of only some 5 times using it. It was my first time using Jquery to target a CSS change and also my first time playing with arrays with Jquery. It was surprisingly easy and pretty fun to construct.
