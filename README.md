# ðŸŽ  Week05 Bootcamp2019a Project: Carousel


# My Awesome Project
 The carousel project was really fun to create. Using some of my faviorte sneakers to output images in the carousel allowed me to have fun with this project, and understand the importance of arrays.   


**Link to project:** coming soon!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 
Using HTML, CSS, JavaScrpit, & jQuery help build the carousel at hand. The carousel was created to output images to HTML using an array in JavaScript. 

The tools used to build Carousel help shape it into the master piece you see today.  Although, fully fuctioning the styling can be touched up.



Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
